# React Movie & TV Show Streaming App

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application that utilizes The Movie Database (TMDB) API to showcase a wide range of movies and TV shows. It's designed with responsiveness in mind, using Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. Users can explore different categories, including trending, top-rated, and detailed seasonal information for TV shows.

## Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: A central hub showcasing movies and TV shows with options to filter by category.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a movie or TV show card opens a detailed page with extensive information, such as cast, genre, ratings, and episode details for TV shows.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the application is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux Toolkit for managing application state, enhancing the performance and scalability.
- **Navigation**: Implements React Router for seamless and intuitive navigation throughout the application.
- **Automatic Scrolling**: Featured sections auto-scroll, improving user interaction and engagement.
